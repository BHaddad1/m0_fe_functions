# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
  Once I get something I do seem to be able to pick it up easily. I do feel like I spend a lot of my time guessing and hoping that my code will run. I wish we had more actual class and more things explained to us.
  It's important for me to go slow so I get it the first time. That might be helpful to others.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
  It's a way to tell a computer to make sense of a lot of different things! I think.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
  Parameters are like the format for what the function will create for the output, and arguments are what we input into the format.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
  I can't think of any, sorry. It's all really knew and overwhelming and I'm still trying to understand it.
